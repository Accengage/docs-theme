Assuming you are a developer and have a basic\nunderstanding of how things work and what StackOverflow is, we won't provide\nguidelines on setting those up. You can verify if you're already good to go\nwith the following commands:\n\n\npython --version\n\n# Python 2.7.2\n\npip --version\n\n# pip 1.5.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling and verifying MkDocs is as simple as:\n\n\npip install mkdocs \n mkdocs --version\n\n# mkdocs, version 0.15.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling Material\n\u00b6\n\n\nNext, assuming you have MkDocs up and running \nmkdocs-material\n can be\ninstalled with \npip\n:\n\n\npip install mkdocs-material\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you haven't already done it, creating a new documentation project is really\nsimple in MkDocs:\n\n\nmkdocs new my-project\n\ncd \nmy-project\n\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs will create the necessary files and base directory structure inside the\nfolder \nmy-project\n. In order to enable the theme just add the following line\nto the auto-generated \nmkdocs.yml\n:\n\n\ntheme\n:\n \nmaterial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your project is hosted on GitHub, add the repository link to the\nconfiguration. If the \nrepo_name\n equals \nGitHub\n, the Material theme will\nadd a download and star button, and display the number of stars:\n\n\nrepo_name\n:\n \nGitHub\n\n\nrepo_url\n:\n \nhttps://github.com/my-github-handle/my-project\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMkDocs includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go -\nvery handy. Spin it up with the following command:\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can go to \nlocalhost:8000\n and the Material\ntheme should be visible. You can now start writing your documentation, or read\non and customize the theme through some options.\n\n\nOptions\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe Material theme adds some extra variables for configuration via your\nproject's \nmkdocs.yml\n. See the following section for all available options.\n\n\nAdding a version\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to add the current version next to the project banner inside the\ndrawer, you can set the variable \nextra.version\n:\n\n\nextra\n:\n\n  \nversion\n:\n \n0.1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will also change the link behind the download button to point to the\narchive with the respective version on GitHub, assuming a release tagged with\nthis exact version identifier.\n\n\nAdding a logo\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf your project has a logo, you can add it to the drawer/navigation by defining\nthe variable \nextra.logo\n. Ideally, the image of your logo should have\nrectangular shape with a minimum resolution of 128x128 and leave some room\ntowards the edges. The logo will also be used as a web application icon on iOS.\nSimply create the folder \ndocs/images\n, add your image and reference it via:\n\n\nextra\n:\n\n  \nlogo\n:\n \nimages/logo.png\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging the font family\n\u00b6\n\n\nMaterial uses the \nUbuntu font family\n by default, specifically the regular\nsans-serif type for text and the monospaced type for code. Both fonts are\nloaded from \nGoogle Fonts\n and can be easily changed to other fonts, like for\nexample Google's own \nRoboto font\n:\n\n\nextra\n:\n\n  \nfont\n:\n\n    \ntext\n:\n \nRoboto\n\n    \ncode\n:\n \nRoboto\n \nMono\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe text font will be loaded in font-weights 400 and 700, the monospaced font\nin regular weight. If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't\nwant to use the Google Fonts loading magic, just set \nextra.font\n to \n'none'\n:\n\n\nextra\n:\n\n  \nfont\n:\n \nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding a GitHub and Twitter account\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you have a GitHub and/or Twitter account, you can add links to your\naccounts to the drawer by setting the variables \nextra.author.github\n and\n\nextra.author.twitter\n respectively:\n\n\nextra\n:\n\n  \nauthor\n:\n\n    \ngithub\n:\n \nmy-github-handle\n\n    \ntwitter\n:\n \nmy-twitter-handle\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore advanced customization\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you want to change the colors or general appearance of the Material theme,\nsee \nthis article\n for more information on advanced\ncustomization.\n\n\nExtensions\n\u00b6\n\n\nMkDocs supports several \nMarkdown extensions\n. The following extensions are\nnot enabled by default (see the link for which are enabled by default), so you\nhave to switch them on explicitly.\n\n\nCodeHilite (recommended)\n\u00b6\n\n\nThis extensions adds code highlighting to fenced code blocks. It might not be\nthe best code highlighter, but it works without JavaScript and on the server:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \ncodehilite(css_class=code)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want more extensive highlighting, you can use a JavaScript library like\n\nhighlight.js\n, which is not included in Material. See \nthis link\n for\nfurther instructions\n\n\nPermalinks\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to add \npermalinks\n to the headers of your article, set the\n\nmarkdown_extensions.toc.permalink\n variable to a symbol, e.g. \n\u00b6\n:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \ntoc\n:\n\n    \npermalink\n:\n \n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe symbol can be chosen freely, it can even be a WebFont icon.\n\n\nAdmonition\n\u00b6\n\n\nAdmonition\n is a handy extension that adds block-styled side content to your\ndocumentation, for example hints, notes or warnings. It can be enabled by\nsetting the variable \nmarkdown_extensions.admonition\n:\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \nadmonition\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to add a note, use the following syntax inside your article:\n\n\n!!! note\n    Nothing to see here, move along.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will print the following block:\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNothing to see here, move along.\n\n\n\n\nThe Material template adds a neutral color for the \nnote\n class and a red color\nfor the \nwarning\n class. You can also add a custom title:\n\n\n!!! warning \nDon\nt try this at home\n\n    If you do, you will regret it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will print:\n\n\n\n\nDon't try this at home\n\n\nIf you do, you will regret it.\n\n\n\n\nMore colors can be freely defined.\n\n\nFull example\n\u00b6\n\n\nBelow is a full example configuration for a mkdocs.yml:\n\n\n# Project information\n\n\nsite_name\n:\n \nMy\n \nProject\n\n\nsite_description\n:\n \nA\n \nshort\n \ndescription\n \nof\n \nmy\n \nproject\n\n\nsite_author\n:\n \nJohn\n \nDoe\n\n\nsite_url\n:\n \nhttps://my-github-handle.github.io/my-project\n\n\n\n# Repository\n\n\nrepo_name\n:\n \nGitHub\n\n\nrepo_url\n:\n \nhttps://github.com/my-github-handle/my-project\n\n\n\n# Copyright\n\n\ncopyright\n:\n \nCopyright\n \n(c)\n \n2016\n \nJohn\n \nDoe\n\n\n\n# Documentation and theme\n\n\ndocs_dir\n:\n \ndocs\n\n\ntheme\n:\n \nmaterial\n\n\n\n# Options\n\n\nextra\n:\n\n  \nversion\n:\n \n0.1.0\n\n  \nlogo\n:\n \nimages/logo.png\n\n  \nfont\n:\n\n    \ntext\n:\n \nRoboto\n\n    \ncode\n:\n \nRoboto\n \nMono\n\n  \nauthor\n:\n\n    \ngithub\n:\n \nmy-github-handle\n\n    \ntwitter\n:\n \nmy-twitter-handle\n\n\n\n# Extensions\n\n\nmarkdown_extensions\n:\n\n  \n-\n \ncodehilite(css_class=code)\n\n  \n-\n \nadmonition\n\n  \n-\n \ntoc\n:\n\n      \npermalink\n:\n \n\u00b6",

However, as you write\nyour documentation, you may reach some point where some small adjustments are\nnecessary to preserve the style.\n\n\nSmall tweaks\n\u00b6\n\n\nMkDocs\n provides a simple way for making small adjustments, that is changing\nsome margins, centering text, etc. Simply put the CSS and Javascript files that\ncontain your adjustments in the \ndocs\n directory (ideally in subdirectories of\ntheir own) and include them via the \nextra_css\n and \nextra_javascript\n\nvariables in your \nmkdocs.yml\n:\n\n\nextra_css\n:\n \n[\n/stylesheets/extra.css\n]\n\n\nextra_javascript\n:\n \n[\n/javascripts/extra.js\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther assistance on including extra CSS and Javascript can be found in the\n\nMkDocs documentation\n.\n\n\nFundamental changes\n\u00b6\n\n\nIf you want to make larger adjustments like changing the color palette or\ntypography, you should check out or download the repository of the project and\ncompile the SASS sources with your changes. The project design is very modular,\nso most things can be tweaked by changing a few variables.\n\n\nSetup\n\u00b6\n\n\nIn order to compile the project, you need \nnode\n with a version greater than\n\n0.11\n up and running. Then, make sure \nbower\n is installed or install it:\n\n\nnpm install -g bower\n\n\n\n\n\nThe project itself is hosted on GitHub, so the next\nthing you should do is clone the project from GitHub:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material\n\n\n\n\n\nThen you change the directory and install all dependencies specified in the\n\npackage.json\n and \nbower.json\n with the following command:\n\n\ncd \nmkdocs-material\nnpm install \n bower install\n\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\n\u00b6\n\n\nThe asset pipeline is contained in \nGulpfile.js\n, which you can start with\n\ngulp watch\n. If you specify the \n--mkdocs\n flag, this will also run\n\nmkdocs serve\n, to monitor changes to the documentation.
